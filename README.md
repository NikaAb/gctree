The project is to come up with (relatively simple) models of B cell diversification within germinal centers that can be used as part of inference. When we say relatively simple, we mean analogous to the coalescent rather than something like

[Meyer-Hermann, M., Mohr, E., Pelletier, N., Zhang, Y., Victora, G. D., & Toellner, K.-M. (2012). A theory of germinal center B cell selection, division, and exit. Cell Reports, 2(1), 162–174.] (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2012.05.010)

The "bright line" dividing the class of models of interest to us are those for which we can compute likelihoods efficiently.

There's going to be some simulation, validation, etc, with this project. For that we use [nestly] (http://nestly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
