The project is to come up with (relatively simple) models of B cell diversification within germinal centers that can be used as part of inference. When we say relatively simple, we mean analogous to the coalescent rather than something like

[Meyer-Hermann, M., Mohr, E., Pelletier, N., Zhang, Y., Victora, G. D., & Toellner, K.-M. (2012). A theory of germinal center B cell selection, division, and exit. Cell Reports, 2(1), 162â€“174.] (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2012.05.010)

The "bright line" dividing the class of models of interest to us are those for which we can compute likelihoods efficiently.

There's going to be some simulation, validation, etc, with this project. For that we use [nestly] (http://nestly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Scripts

* TasParse.py - this reads the Tas data excel file, extracts the sequences from lymph node 2 germinal center 1, aligns with muscle, and prints to phyllip format.
* recurse.py - classes for simulating, and compute likelihoods, for collapsed trees generated from a binary branching process with mutation and infinite types, as well as forests of such trees. The main routine performs some tests using a simulated forest and outputs plots foo.pdf and bar.pdf.
	* foo.pdf shows the 2-norm of the difference between the analytical likelihood gradient and a finite difference approximation over the parameter space. Hopefully it is small everywhere
	* bar.pdf shows the likelihood surface for the randomized forest with the true parameters (red) and MLE parameters (blue)
