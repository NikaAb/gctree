The project is to come up with (relatively simple) models of B cell diversification within germinal centers that can be used as part of inference. When we say relatively simple, we mean analogous to the coalescent rather than something like

The "bright line" dividing the class of models of interest to us are those for which we can compute likelihoods efficiently.

There's going to be some simulation, validation, etc, with this project. For that we use [nestly] (http://nestly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Scripts

* TasParse.py - this reads the Tas data excel file, extracts the sequences from lymph node 2 germinal center 1, aligns with muscle, and prints to phyllip format.
* recurse.py - classes for simulating, and compute likelihoods, for collapsed trees generated from a binary branching process with mutation and infinite types, as well as forests of such trees.
	* The main routine takes a phlyip outtree file as a command line argument and prints collapsed trees and their likelihoods for each tree in the file
	* In a test mode, the main routine also performs a test of the likelihood against a by-hand calculation for a simple tree, and simulates a forest of trees and performs MLE. It outputs plot foo.pdf.
	* "python recurse.py -h" for details on command line args
