# gctree

The project is to come up with (relatively simple) models of B cell diversification within germinal centers that can be used as part of inference. When we say relatively simple, we mean analogous to the coalescent rather than something like

The "bright line" dividing the class of models of interest to us are those for which we can compute likelihoods efficiently.

There's going to be some simulation, validation, etc, with this project. For that we use [nestly] (http://nestly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## scons pipelines

* Inference pipeline: `scons --outdir=[path to output] --fasta=[path to Tas et al. style fasta] --naiveID=[ID of naive sequence in fasta file, default 'naive']`
* Simulation/validation pipeline: `scons --validation --outdir=[path to output] --naive=[DNA seq of naive sequence from which to start simulating, used default if omitted] --mutability=[path to S5F mutability file, default 'S5F/mutability'] --substitution=[path to S5F substitution file, default 'S5F/substitution'] --p=[branching probability for simulation, default 0.49] --lambda0=[baseline mutation rate, default .3] --r=[sampling probability, default 1.] --n=[minimum simulation sequence set size, default 100]`
* gctree.py - library for simulating, and compute likelihoods, for collapsed trees generated from a binary branching process with mutation and infinite types, as well as forests of such trees. General usage info `gctree.py --help`. There are three subprograms, each of which has usage info:
	* `gctree.py inference --help`: takes an `outfile` file made by phylip's `dnapars` as a command line argument, converts each tree therein to a collapsed tree, and ranks by likelihood under our model.
	* `gctree.py simulation --help`: simulate data under branching model, plus S5F and imperfect sampling.
	* `gctree.py validation --help`
	* `gctree.py test --help`: performs a test of the likelihood against a by-hand calculation for a simple tree, and simulates a forest of trees and performs MLE, outputting plots validating MLE and gradients.
